        America, 1899. The end of the Wild West era has begun. After a robbery
        goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and
        the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the
        best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must
        rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in
        order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the
        gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty
        to the gang who raised him.
